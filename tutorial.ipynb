    "Molecular dynamics (MD) is a versatile method for simulating the time-dependent behavior of molecular systems. This notebook demonstrates how MD simulations can be run using the GROMACS software to study the self-assembly of lipids. To accelerate the simulations, a coarse-grained (CG) model using the Martini force field is employed. In addition, parallel processing with multiple CPU cores is leveraged to demonstrate the principle of high-performance computing (HPC)."

To this end, check the previous `insert-molecules` and `solvate` outputs for the number of lipids and solvent molecules that were *de facto* added. Paste these numbers after the `{lipid.value}` and `{solvent.value}` variables in the command below (replace `N_LIPID_MOLS` and `N_SOLVENT_MOLS`).\n",
