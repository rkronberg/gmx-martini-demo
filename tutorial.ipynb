    "Molecular dynamics (MD) is a versatile method for simulating the time-dependent behavior of molecular systems. This notebook demonstrates how MD simulations can be run using the [GROMACS](https://www.gromacs.org/) software to study the self-assembly of lipids. To accelerate the simulations, a coarse-grained (CG) model using the [Martini force field](http://cgmartini.nl/) is employed. Here, multiple atoms are condensed into larger beads (\"superatoms\"), decreasing the computational cost of the simulations compared to simulating each atom explicitly (all-atom representation). In addition, parallel processing with multiple CPU cores is leveraged to demonstrate the principle of high-performance computing (HPC)."

However, before visualizing the trajectory stored in `md.xtc` we need to fix some connectivity issues. The simulation we ran exploited the concept of *periodic boundary conditions* (PBC), meaning that molecules can cross the system boundaries and end up on the opposite side of the cell – a convenient trick for modeling extended condensed phases. Depending on how you visualize your system (bonds included or not), a side-effect may be that some bonds seem to artificially stretch across the simulation cell. The following command will fix this potential issue."

    "What happened? In the first frame of the simulation the lipids are more or less randomly scattered within the box. As you scroll to the end, they seem to be organizing somehow (note the periodic boundary conditions!). To understand the thermodynamics behind this process, one needs consider the *amphiphilic* character of lipids – they have a hydrophilic head group and a hydrophobic (lipophilic) tail. Depending on the solvent, they self-assemble in a way that minimizes their *free energy* $\\Delta G$. In essence, polar head groups tend to cluster together if the solvent is non-polar (like octadecane) whereas the hydrophobic tails favorably embed within the solvent. On the other hand, if the solvent is polar (like water), the lipophilic tails group together while the head groups orient toward the solvent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of self-assembly is *spontaneous* because the system can decrease its free energy by aggregating in a specific way. Typically systems tend toward a state of maximal entropy, but in this case the system is becoming more ordered so the entropy is strangely decreasing! The free energy is, however, crucially affected also by the enthalpy change, which in this case is highly negative as the aggregation results in a more optimal electrostatic interaction. This yields an overall negative free energy change, \n",

    "\n",
    "where $V_t$ and $l_t$ are the volume and length of the tail, respectively, whereas $A_h$ denotes the cross-sectional surface area of the head group. Assuming a polar solvent, lipids with large head groups ($\\mathrm{CPP}\\leq1/3$) typically form spherical micelles, whereas cylinders and vesicles are possible with slightly smaller heads ($1/3<\\mathrm{CPP}\\leq1/2$, e.g. LPC). If the lipid is rather cylindrical ($1/2<\\mathrm{CPP}\\leq1$, e.g. DPPC), various bilayers are likely to form. Conversely, in non-polar solvents lipids self-assemble into inverted micelles. Inversion is also possible in a polar solvent if the head group is very small ($\\mathrm{CPP}>1$, e.g. POPE), yielding self-assembled structures where the solvent is essentially encapsulated within cavities bordered by hydrophilic heads.\n",
