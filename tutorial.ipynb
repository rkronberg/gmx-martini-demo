    "Molecular dynamics (MD) is a versatile method for simulating the time-dependent behavior of molecular systems. This notebook demonstrates how MD simulations can be run using the GROMACS software to study the self-assembly of lipids. To accelerate the simulations, a coarse-grained (CG) model using the Martini force field is employed. In addition, parallel processing with multiple CPU cores is leveraged to demonstrate the principles of high-performance computing (HPC)."
